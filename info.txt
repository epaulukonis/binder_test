Open Science for Grand Challenges
Geospatial Dimensions
11/22/2021
Preparation:  This week, Dr. Vashek Petras will lead a hands-on open science tutorial. Please bring your laptop to class.
Part I. Introduction Lecture (9:35-10:10): Slides can be accessed here: Python in Binder.
We will look at two examples:
Simple example
Geospatial example
Part II. Hands-on Exercise (10:10-10:50): Your goal is to create a Git repository which opens in Binder and contains a script and a notebook.
Directions:
If you don't have it already, create an account on GitHub (https://github.com).
Create a new (Git) repository on GitHub.
Write a trivial Python script
c = a + b followed by print(c) or something similar is sufficient.
You can create and edit files on GitHub using the web interface
Open the repository using Binder at mybinder.org.
Create a new notebook.
New button in top right corner. Pick (notebook:) Python 3.
Name the notebook at the top of the page (Example or Test 1 are good names here).
Run the script from the notebook (!python script_name.py).
Optionally, add some Python code to the notebook itself.
Download the notebook.
You should end up with file with .ipynb extension.
Upload the file to your repository on GitHub.
Repeat as needed.
Typically, you would develop your code elsewhere avoiding the cumbersome update loop like in this workflow.
JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook in Binder allow you to save the document to your web browser storage allowing you to pick up where you left last time.
It is not advised (by Binder) to upload to GitHub from Binder for security reasons (or enter any credentials) for security reasons (this may change in the future).
Include link to Binder (the Launch Binder button) to your readme file.
Specify you want to use JupyterLab (instead of Jupyter Notebook) using ?urlpath=lab.
Make it show your notebook right away by extending the above to ?urlpath=lab/tree/Example.ipynb where Example.ipynb is name of your notebook.
Extra tasks:
Write code which uses rasterio to display data or to get its CRS in the notebook.
Put that code into a separate file and use it in notebook.
Do not run the file.
Make it so that it works for the data display and that you can store the CRS in a variable.
Break (10:50 - 11:05)
Part III. Geospatial and more advanced examples (11:05 - 11:45)
Examples using Binder:
Hydrology and zonal statistics in GRASS GIS in JupyterLab
